I want to build a data-driven project regarding the European deeptech startups.
I am considering how to use data from the EPO (European Patent Office).
Here is their website: https://dtf.epo.org/datav/public/dashboard-frontend/host_epoorg.html#/explore?dataSet=1
The broader problem I am interested in as a researcher is the seeming performance gap between European startups and American startups.
The repository will contain some reports published on European or French startups, but I think those are mostly 'descriptive' studies - not really informing us on what's really happening.
This repository will be used, with your help, to find ways to maybe 'correlate' the EPO data to other sources of data.
Feel free to suggests me other sources of data. For the moment, two types of data I am interested in are: a) publicly available descriptions of the product and b) other publicly available information related to a given startup (e.g. partnership announcements, presence, branding, perceived strategy...)

The idea of this repository is to use LLM-based agents and coding assistants to build a unique dataset, to come up with meaningful variables that could be extracted from the above sources (or any other sources we can extract).
To build such database, we would need to build and maintain web scrapers, to define a list of meaningful publishable variables, our various prompts to extract variables from the scraped data. 

Never create extra documentation files if we already have a documentation .md file under that folder.
Avoid at all cost inflating file structure unnecessarily.
